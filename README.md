# HTTP Server – Learning Project

This is a small project I started on **August 6, 2025**, to learn more about networking, specifically how HTTP works under the hood.

## 🛠️ Progress Log

### 06.08.2025
- ✅ Got basic sockets working.
- ✅ Server responds to `curl` requests with a simple **"Hello, world"** HTTP response.
- ⚠️ Does not yet parse incoming request data (no method/path/header parsing).


### 07.08.2025
- ✅ Got simple multithreading to handle multiple requests better.
- ✅ started working on the parse code but only got the start so far.

## 🔜 Next Steps


- [ ] Parse incoming data.
